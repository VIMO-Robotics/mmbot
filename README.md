## Map
![image](https://github.com/Sensing-Intelligent-System/sis_competition_base_TA/blob/devel-sean/img/map.jpeg)
The map is consists of 15 60\*60\*1cm jigsaw mats. Around the map we put eight apriltags as artificial features. The location of all map objects are marked by type to facilitate reproduction after the venue is moved. In front of the tag on the left side of the figure above, there is a platform for placing items that require movement in the task, and three boxes on the right side of the tags are used to place them.  
The position of each object is recored in tables below. The origin of the coordinate is the jigsaw mat in the lower left corner of the figure, the positive direction of X axis is the long side of the map and Y axis is the short side.
